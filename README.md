# Data-Salaries-Cleaning-and-Dashboarding

This repository contains a python notebook where I clean a dataset to later be used for visualizations on tableau.
You can also view the dashboard I made with the data in tableau [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/Data_Professional_Salary_Summary/DataJobSalariesDSHBRD?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
